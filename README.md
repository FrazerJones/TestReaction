# TestReaction
A simple tool for testing your reaction time right in your browser!

This project was the creation of a simple chrome extension that would act as an on-demand reaction time test for the user. It works with the straightforward implementation of a button and timer, along with some more HTML, javascript and CSS, to let the user start a reaction time test from their browser with an easy-to-use interface and accurately display their reaction time to pressing a button after it changes colour.
